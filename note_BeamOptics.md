title: Influence of Emitter Surface Roughness and Emission inhomogeneity
---

## Key components of Gyrotron

- investigate the influence of the quality of the emitter on the quality of electron beam nad gyrotron efficiency
- KIT in house code
  - ESRAY
  - ESPIC
- The nuemerical surface roughness model can be
  - used to simulate the influence of the surface roughness
  - on beam quality, gyrotron efficiency, and mode competition
  - calculated using the surface roughness model
- The emission inhomogeneity information can be
  - evaluated from the measured Current Voltage Characteristics CVCs
  - three methodss to evaluate the emission inhomogeneity from CVC
  - give the new definition of emission inhomogeneity
- Vacuum Electron Device VED
- Electron Beam Optics System EBOS
  - consisit of the MIG and beam tunnels of gyrotron
  - generate a hollow electron beaqm for the cavity with sufficient traverse volicity $v_{T}$
